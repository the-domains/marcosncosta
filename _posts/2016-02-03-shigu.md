  Shigu!! One of the many potential sport climbing areas in the Chinese
  Southwest. I have been spending loads of time in this area and hope to
  establish many more climbs. "The Cave" was the first area we bolted. Fully
  featured with tufas, pockets, edges and slopers it offers great 3D climbing.
