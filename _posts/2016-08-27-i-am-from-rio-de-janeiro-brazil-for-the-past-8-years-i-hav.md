Experience

In the past I focused mainly in Sport Climbing, however for the  
past 4 years I have been trying to focus more on alpine climbing. I have been traveling the world establishing new lines and repeating classical routes in places such as Patagonia in Argentina, Karakoram in Pakistan, Himalaya in Nepal, Chamonix in France, Cogne in Italy, Siguniang Area in Sichuan, China.
